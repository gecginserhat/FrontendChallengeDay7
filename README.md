🎯 Day 7 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I continued with Bootstrap, focusing on some essential components for building interactive websites. 🖥️<br/>

🔍 Here's what I worked on:<br/>

- Tables & Lists: Styled tables and lists to display data in a clean and organized manner.<br/>
- Forms & Inputs: Built forms with various input types, enhancing user interaction.<br/>
- Navigation & Dropdowns: Created navigational menus with dropdowns, making site navigation more user-friendly.<br/>

🔥 Bootstrap’s components make building complex layouts a breeze. Tomorrow, I’m excited to dive into JavaScript and add dynamic functionality to my projects!<br/>
